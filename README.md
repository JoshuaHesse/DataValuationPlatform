# Data Valuation Platform

## Overview
The Data Valuation Platform is a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate and quantify the influence of data in various machine learning models. This platform integrates multiple algorithms and techniques to provide a robust analysis of data value.

## Features
- **Model Integration**: The platform supports various models, including CatBoost, DVRL, KNN Shapley, and MVSA, each offering unique approaches to data valuation.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Utilizes a range of metrics and methods to assess data influence, ensuring a thorough and nuanced analysis.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Offers flexibility in configuring model parameters to suit different datasets and requirements.

## Models
1. **CatBoost Model**: An implementation of the CatBoost algorithm, known for handling categorical data efficiently. [View Code](https://github.com/JoshuaHesse/DataValuationPlatform/blob/master/DataValuationPlatform/models/catboost/CatBoost_model.py)
2. **DVRL Model**: Integrates the DVRL (Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning) approach for data valuation. [View Code](https://github.com/JoshuaHesse/DataValuationPlatform/blob/master/DataValuationPlatform/models/dvrl/DVRL_model.py)
3. **KNN Shapley Model**: Applies the KNN Shapley method, a technique based on Shapley values, for assessing data influence. [View Code](https://github.com/JoshuaHesse/DataValuationPlatform/blob/master/DataValuationPlatform/models/knn_shapley/KNN_Shapley_model.py)
4. **MVSA Model**: Implements the MVSA (Most Valuable Subset Analysis) for evaluating data subsets. [View Code](https://github.com/JoshuaHesse/DataValuationPlatform/blob/master/DataValuationPlatform/models/mvsa/MVSA_model.py)
