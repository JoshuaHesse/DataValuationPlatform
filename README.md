Overview

The Data Valuation Platform is a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate and quantify the influence of data in various machine learning models. This platform integrates multiple algorithms and techniques to provide a robust analysis of data value.
Features

    Model Integration: The platform supports various models, including CatBoost, DVRL, KNN Shapley, and MVSA, each offering unique approaches to data valuation.
    Comprehensive Metrics: Utilizes a range of metrics and methods to assess data influence, ensuring a thorough and nuanced analysis.
    Customizable Parameters: Offers flexibility in configuring model parameters to suit different datasets and requirements.

Models

    CatBoost Model: An implementation of the CatBoost algorithm, known for handling categorical data efficiently. [CatBoost Model Code](/DataValuationPlatform/models/catboost/CatBoost_model.py)

    DVRL Model: Integrates the DVRL (Data Valuation using Reinforcement Learning) approach for data valuation. View Code
    KNN Shapley Model: Applies the KNN Shapley method, a technique based on Shapley values, for assessing data influence. View Code
    MVSA Model: Implements the MVSA (Most Valuable Subset Analysis) for evaluating data subsets. View Code
